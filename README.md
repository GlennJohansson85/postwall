## 6.2 Testing of User Stories (From Chapter 1.1)

**1.1.1 First Time User Goals:**
a) As a "First Time User", I want to quickly understand the purpose of the website.
> The landing page, homepage, is where all posts are located. The first thing the user sees is a uploaded post, the name of the website, Postwall, shining in green. By reading the nav-links, and the placerholder text "Search for a Post" in the search field the Visitor should get a clear understanding of the purpose.

b) As a "First Time User", I want to navigate through the site.
> Navigation system is easy to use. Nav-links, shines in bright green showing the user which page she is currently one. Navbar is fixated at the top, always easy to access.

c) As a "First Time User", I want to browse posts.
> The landing page, is where all posts are uploaded in a descending order. The only thing the visitor needs to do is to scroll the mousewheel to see all the uploaded content.

**1.1.2 Returning User Goals:**
a) As a "Returning User", I want to search for posts.
> As previously mentioned, users have the ability to browse posts. To enhance the experience, a search field is available in the navbar, allowing users to quickly find specific posts. When users type keywords, post titles containing those terms will appear in a dropdown list or on a dedicated results page, providing an efficient way to find relevant content.

b) As a "Returning User", I want to register to the site.
> A returning user means a curious user. A unregistered user cant engage and share their content. By redirecting the user to the login page, when trying to access the post page, we engage the user to register. Through the login page there is a clear link, in the center of the page, which asks the user to register. Also, by pressing the profile nav-link anoter link to the login page is presented.

c) As a "Returning User", I want to post.
> When registered, The user can create posts easily by just clicking on the Post link in the navbar. To upload a post the user just needs to provide a title, a short text (content) and optionally a image.

**1.1.3 Frequent User Goals:**
a) As a "Frequent User", I want to share my views/comment on others content.
> Each post has a comment form beneath it. All registered users can use this to comment. Commenting is done within the same page the post is uploaded. Placeholder text, in bright purple, show sthe user where to input their comment. Beneath the field is the post button located. All comments are in a ascending order with the latest at the bottom.  After posting a comment, the website refreshes, and the user is scrolled to the same post so the user can see the comment has been successfully submitted.

b) As a "Frequent User", I want to have the freedom to regret them aswell.
> All authors can delete their own content with the exception that if a author/admin decides to delete a post. Included comments will also be deleted. A user cant delete others content due to the delete buttons is only visible for the uploader. The delete buttons are next to each post/comment in the post details page making it easy to do so.

c) As a "Frequent User", I want to see content in a larger scale.
> By accessing the post details the user will be able to see a post in a larger scale.


### 6.1.4 Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### 6.1.5 Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

## 7. Deployment

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### 7.2 Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account.

### 7.3 Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
