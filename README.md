-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        Postwall is a blog platform where users can share their content (text/images) with other registered users. 

        All posts are displayed on the main page (Postwall) in descending order. Each post includes metadata showing the author's username and timestamp.

        Registered users can add comments to each post, which are displayed in ascending order, with the commentator's username at the beginning of each comment.

        Posts/Comments can only be deleted by the author or the website administrators. (If a post is deleted, its comments will be removed as well.)

        To bring this project to life with all of its functionalities (described in the "Features" section), I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, as well as the Bootstrap framework and jQuery.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        The goal of the project is to keep things as simple as possible. Users can share posts, which are displayed on the main page "postwall." Using JavaScript, users can add   comments directly on the main page without being redirected to the individual post detail page. After submitting a comment, the user is automatically returned to the same post, rather than being taken back to the top of the page.

        The search function searches for post titles which is displayed as a dropdown list. When clicked the user is directed to the location of the post. 

        These userfriendly functionalities and the design of the website is what keep users coming back to the website.
